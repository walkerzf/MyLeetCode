## [1494. Parallel Courses II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/parallel-courses-ii/)

> Given the integer n representing the number of courses at some university labeled from 1 to n, and the array dependencies where``` dependencies[i]  = [xi, yi]```  represents a prerequisite relationship, that is, the course xi must be taken before the course ```yi```.  Also, you are given the integer k.
>
> In one semester you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites for the courses you are taking.
>
> Return the minimum number of semesters to take all courses. It is guaranteed that you can take all courses in some way. 
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> ```

> Input: n = 4, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]], k = 2
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case we can take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester, then take course 1 in the second semester and finally take course 4 in the third semester.

> Input: n = 5, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[1,5]], k = 2
> Output: 4 
> Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case one optimal way to take all courses is: take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester and take course 4 in the second semester, then take course 1 in the third semester and finally take course 5 in the fourth semester.
> Example 3:
> ```
>
> ```
> Input: n = 11, dependencies = [], k = 2
> Output: 6

> ```
> Constraints:
> 
> 1 <= n <= 15
> 1 <= k <= n
> 0 <= dependencies.length <= n * (n-1) / 2
> dependencies[i].length == 2
> 1 <= xi, yi <= n
> xi != yi
> All prerequisite relationships are distinct, that is, dependencies[i] != dependencies[j].
> The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
