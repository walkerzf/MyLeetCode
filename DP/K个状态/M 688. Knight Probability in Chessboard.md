## [688. Knight Probability in Chessboard](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/knight-probability-in-chessboard/)

> On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
>
> A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

>
> Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
>
> The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

> 
> Example:
> 
> Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
> Output: 0.0625
> Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
> From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
> The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
> 
> 
> Note:
> 
> N will be between 1 and 25.
> K will be between 0 and 100.
> The knight always initially starts on the board.

## Solution DP

* it must walk at exactly k times 

```java
//time 5ms 37.9MB
class Solution {
    public double knightProbability(int N, int K, int r, int c) {
        int dir[][]={{-1,2},{-1,-2},{1,2},{1,-2},{2,1},{2,-1},{-2,1},{-2,-1}};

                    }
                }

        }
        double count=0;

            for(int j=0;j<N;j++){
                count+=dp[K][i][j];

        return count/Math.pow(8,K);

```java
//time 4ms

    int[] X = new int[]{-1, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1};
    int[] Y = new int[]{-2, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1, -2};
    double[][][] dp;

    public double knightProbability(int N, int K, int r, int c) {
        dp = new double[N][N][K + 1];
        return dfs(r, c, N, K);
    }

            int y = c + Y[i];
            if(x < 0 || x >= N || y < 0 || y >= N) continue;
