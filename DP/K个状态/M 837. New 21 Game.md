## [837. New 21 Game](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/new-21-game/)

> Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
>
> Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
>
> Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
> Output: 1.00000
> Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
> Output: 0.60000
> Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
> In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
> Output: 0.73278
> ```

> ```
> Note:
> 
> 0 <= K <= N <= 10000
> 1 <= W <= 10000
> Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

* it is actually different from the knight walk on the board
* but is similiar with the climb  stairs 

## Solution DFS 

* TLE
* In this problem ,we meet the situation we may stop early ,the calculation of possibility  may be difficult

```java
	//TLE
	class Solution {
    double res=0;
    public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {  
        dfs(N,0,K,W,0);
        for(int i=0;i<=N;i++){
            for(int j=0 ;j<=N ;j++)
        }
        return res;
    }
    private double dfs(int N,int currentSum ,int K, int W,int dep ){
        if(currentSum>=K){
            if(currentSum<=N)
                //we calculation the possibility every time 
            res+=(double)(1.0/Math.pow(W,dep));
            return;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<=W;i++){
            dfs(N,currentSum+i,K,W,dep+1);
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution 

* when we can get  point i at   x times card selection ,and x-1 times, we must get ``` i -W ~i-1``` , so the possibility == ``` i -W ~i-1``` possibility
* Ref:https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/discuss/132334/One-Pass-DP-O(N)
* ``` dp[ i ]= ( Last W  dp values  sum) / W```   -> key

```java
//time 4ms

class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {  
        if(K==0||N>=K + W)  return 1.0;
        double dp[]=new double [N+1];
        // 0 ==1.0
        dp[0]=1.0;
        double res=0;
        double preW=1.0;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            dp[i]=preW/W;
            if(i<K){
                //int the resonable range ,we increase the preW
                preW+=dp[i];
            }else{
                res+=dp[i];
            }
            //we slide window ,every loop minus one possiblitiy
            if((i-W)>=0) preW-=dp[i-W];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

* the basic idea is slide window
* but use difference equation to compute
