## [813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/)

> We partition a row of numbers A into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?
>
> Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.
>
> ```
> Example:
> Input: 
> A = [9,1,2,3,9]
> K = 3
> Output: 20
> Explanation: 
> The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
> We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
> That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.
> 
> 
> Note:
> 
> 1 <= A.length <= 100.
> 1 <= A[i] <= 10000.
> 1 <= K <= A.length.
> Answers within 10^-6 of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.

## Solution DP 

* 状态定义，每个index分i各组（```index<length  i<K```）

```java
//time 9ms
class Solution {
    public double largestSumOfAverages(int[] A, int K) {
        double dp[][]=new double[A.length+1][K+1];
        int subSum[]=new int[A.length+1];
        for(int i=1;i<=A.length;i++){
            subSum[i]=subSum[i-1]+A[i-1];
            dp[i][1]=(double)(subSum[i]*1.0/i);
        }
         for(int j=2;j<=K;j++){
             //剪枝
            for(int i=2;i<=A.length;i++){
                //剪枝
                for(int l=i-1;l>=j-1;l--){
                    double tmp=(double)((subSum[i]-subSum[l])*1.0/(i-l));
                    dp[i][j]=Math.max(dp[i][j],tmp+dp[l][j-1]);
                }      
            }
        }
        return dp[A.length][K];
    }
