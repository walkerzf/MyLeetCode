## 题干

> Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
>
> In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.
>
> You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: 
> Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
> Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
>
>
> Example 2:
>
> Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
> Output: 9
> Explanation: 
> Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
> Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
> 9 total points are earned.
>
>
> Note:
>
> The length of nums is at most 20000.
> Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].

## Solution 样例

```java
//time 1ms
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        else if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        int max = nums[0];
        for(int i = 0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]>max) max = nums[i];
        }
        int temp[] = new int[max+1];
        for(int num : nums){
            temp[num]++;
        }

        int[] dp = new int[max+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = temp[1]*1;
        dp[2] = Math.max(dp[1],temp[2]*2);
        for(int i = 2;i<=max;i++){
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+i*temp[i]);
        }
        return dp[max];
    }
}
