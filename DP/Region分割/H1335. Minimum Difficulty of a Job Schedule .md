## [1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)

> You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
>
> You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
>
> Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].
>
> Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

> Example 1:
> 
> 
> Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
> Output: 7
> Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
> Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
> The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
> Output: -1
> Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
> Example 4:
> 
> Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
> Output: 15
> Example 5:
> 
> Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
> Output: 843
> 
> 
> Constraints:
> 
> 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
> 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
> 1 <= d <= 10

## Solution DP

* 可以在for循环中求解最大值，不必单独求，不过这样看起来更直观

```java
//time  13ms 11ms
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int len=jobDifficulty.length;
        int max[][]=new int[len][len];
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            for(int j=i;j<len;j++){
                if(i==j) {
                    max[i][j]=jobDifficulty[i];
                }else{
                    max[i][j]=Math.max(max[i][j-1],jobDifficulty[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        int dp[][]=new int[len][d+1];
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            Arrays.fill(dp[i],Integer.MAX_VALUE/2);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            dp[i][1]=max[0][i];
            for(int k=2;k<=d;k++){
                for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
                    dp[i][k]=Math.min(dp[i][k],((j==0)?0:dp[j-1][k-1])+max[j][i]);
            }
        }   
    }
    if(dp[len-1][d]==Integer.MAX_VALUE/2) return -1;
    return dp[len-1][d];
    }
}
```
