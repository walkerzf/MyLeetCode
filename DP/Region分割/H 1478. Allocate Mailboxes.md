## [1478. Allocate Mailboxes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/allocate-mailboxes/)

> Given the array `houses` and an integer `k`. where `houses[i]` is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.
>
> Return the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.
>
> The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**

>
> ```
> Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.
> Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> **![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)**
>
> ```
> Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
> Output: 9
> Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.
> Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1
> Output: 8
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```
> Input: houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4
> Output: 0
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `n == houses.length`
> - `1 <= n <= 100`
> - `1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4`
> - `1 <= k <= n`
> - Array `houses` contain unique integers.

## Solution DP

* we  pre compute the cost   of  the every possible pair  region  have only one mailbox
* we define the condition``` dp [i] [j] ```, i means the former i houses use j mail box , we need to iterative the last region ,to compute the min of``` dp [i] [j] =Math.min(dp[i] [j],dp [l] [j-1]+cost [l+1] [i])```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(int[] houses, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        int n = houses.length ;
        int cost [][] =new int [n][n];
        int dp[][] =new int[n][k+1];
        //initialize
        //easy problem for math quesiton 
        //but it is diiffcult to code ? no 
        for(int i =0 ; i< n ;i++){
            for(int j=i;j<n;j++){
                int mid =(i+j)/2;
                for(int m=i;m<=j;m++){
                    //only one mailbox , the box in the middle place will bring
                    //minimum cost 
                    cost[i][j]+=Math.abs(houses[m]-houses[mid]);
                }
            }
        }
        //initialize 
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) Arrays.fill(dp[i],Integer.MAX_VALUE/2);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) dp[i][1]=cost[0][i];
        
        //dp to figure the problem 
        for(int l =2;l<=k;l++){
            for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
                //j from 0-index
                for(int j =l-2 ;j<i;j++){
                    dp[i][l]=Math.min(dp[i][l],cost[j+1][i]+dp[j][l-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n-1][k];
    }
}
