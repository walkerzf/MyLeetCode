## [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).
>
> Example 1:
> Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
> Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
> Example 2:
> Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
> Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

## Solution

```java
	//time 2ms 40.4MB
	class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        int dp[]=new int[nums.length];
        int max=1;
        dp[0]=1;
        //for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){ dp[i]=1;}
        for(int i=1;i<dp.length;i++){
            dp[i]=1;
            if(nums[i]>nums[i-1]){
                dp[i]=Math.max(dp[i],dp[i-1]+1);
                max=Math.max(dp[i],max);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
