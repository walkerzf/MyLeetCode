## 1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II]

> On an infinite number line, the position of the ```i-th``` stone is given by ```stones[i]```.  Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position.
>
> Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.
>
> In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.
>
> The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.
>
> When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?  Return the answer as an length 2 array: answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: [7,4,9]
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: 
> We can move 4 -> 8 for one move to finish the game.
> Or, we can move 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6 for two moves to finish the game.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: [6,5,4,3,10]
> Output: [2,3]
> We can move 3 -> 8 then 10 -> 7 to finish the game.
> Or, we can move 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 9 to finish the game.
> Notice we cannot move 10 -> 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: [100,101,104,102,103]
> Output: [0,0]
> 
> 
> Note:
> 
> 3 <= stones.length <= 10^4
> 1 <= stones[i] <= 10^9
> stones[i] have distinct values.
