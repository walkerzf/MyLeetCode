> A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appoint­ ment requests, find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.

class Solution {
    public int massage(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        if(nums.length==1) return nums[0];
        int dp []=new int [nums.length+1];
        dp[1]=nums[0];
       // dp[1]=Math.max(nums[0],nums[1]);
        for(int i=2;i<dp.length;i++){
            dp[i]=Math.max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[dp.length-1];
    }
}
