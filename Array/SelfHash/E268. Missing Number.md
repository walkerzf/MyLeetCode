## [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/missing-number/)

> Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

> Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
> Output: 8
> Note:
> Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Solution ^ operation

* the point is the linear complexity and constant extra space 

```java
//time  0ms

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        //O(N)
        int res=nums.length;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            res^=nums[i];
            res^=i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

* sort the array 
* the  sum of the array we can do the add with the sub
* HashSet





* have a zero ,so seems we can not use self hash
