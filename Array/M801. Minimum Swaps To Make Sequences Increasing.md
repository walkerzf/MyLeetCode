## [801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/)

> 		We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

> We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.
>
> At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

## Solution

## **Explanation**

swap[n]` means the minimum swaps to make the `A[i]` and `B[i]` sequences increasing for `0 <= i <= n`,
in condition that we swap `A[n]` and `B[n]`
`not_swap[n]` is the same with `A[n]` and `B[n]` not swapped.

@Acker help explain:

1. `A[i - 1] < A[i] && B[i - 1] < B[i]`.
 In this case, if we want to keep A and B increasing before the index i, can only have two choices.
-> 1.1 don't swap at (i-1) and don't swap at i, we can get `not_swap[i] = not_swap[i-1]`
   -> 1.2 swap at (i-1) and swap at i, we can get `swap[i] = swap[i-1]+1`
   if swap at (i-1) and do not swap at i, we can not guarantee A and B increasing.
   
2. `A[i-1] < B[i] && B[i-1] < A[i]`
 In this case, if we want to keep A and B increasing before the index i, can only have two choices.
   -> 2.1 swap at (i-1) and do not swap at i, we can get
   
    `notswap[i] = Math.min(swap[i-1], notswap[i] )`
-> 2.2 do not swap at (i-1) and swap at i, we can get 
   
   `swap[i]=Math.min(notswap[i-1]+1, swap[i])`
   
```java
   class Solution {
       public int minSwap(int[] A, int[] B) {
           int keep[]=new int[A.length];
           int swap[]=new int[A.length];
           keep[0]=0;
           swap[0]=1;
           for(int i=1;i<keep.length;i++){
               swap[i]=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
               keep[i]=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
               if(A[i-1]<A[i]&&B[i-1]<B[i]){
                   //no need for swap
                   keep[i]=keep[i-1];
                   //swap i-1 alsp swap i
                   swap[i]=swap[i-1]+1;
               }
               if(A[i-1]<B[i]&&B[i-1]<A[i]){
                   // i-1 not swap
                   swap[i]=Math.min(keep[i-1]+1,swap[i]);
                   //swap i-1  no swap for i
                   keep[i]=Math.min(swap[i-1],keep[i]);
               }
           }
           return Math.min(keep[keep.length-1],swap[swap.length-1]);
       }
   }
   ```
