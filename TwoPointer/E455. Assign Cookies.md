> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
>
> Note:
> You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
> You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
>
> Example 1:
> Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
> And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
> You need to output 1.
> Example 2:
> Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
> You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
> You need to output 2.

## Solution Two Pointer

* 这实际上也是贪心的思想
  * 利用最大的饼干来满足最大的需求（如果满足不了，那么更小的饼干也满足不了，则应该选择更小的需求）。
  * 或是利用最小的饼干来满足需求（如果最小的饼干满足不了最小的需求，那么只能尝试更大的饼干，无论如何饼干每次都会++，而满足的数量不一定++）

```java
//time 8ms 42.2MB
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int pointerg=g.length-1;
        int pointers=s.length-1;
        int contentnumber=0;
        while(pointerg>=0&&pointers>=0){
            if(s[pointers]>=g[pointerg]){
                pointerg--;
                pointers--;
                contentnumber++;
            }
            else if(s[pointers]<g[pointerg]){
                pointerg--;
            }
            
        }
        return contentnumber;
    }
}
```
