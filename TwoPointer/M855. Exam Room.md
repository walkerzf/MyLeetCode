## 题干

> In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.
>
> When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)
>
> Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.
>
>  
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
> Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
> Explanation:
> ExamRoom(10) -> null
> seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
> seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
> seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
> seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
> leave(4) -> null
> seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
>
>
> Note:
>
> 1 <= N <= 10^9
> ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 10^4 times across all test cases.
> Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently sitting in seat number p.



* 这题关键是在储存已经坐下学生位置的一个有序数组
  * 我考虑用```Collections.sort```，结果时间为1252ms
    * 考虑用```binary Search```，时间变为600ms左右
  * 由于我的```List```实例化的时候用的```LinkedList```， 改为```ArraysList``` ，之后时间变为32ms
    * 为什么这两种树结构差别那么大啊…



**将每次计算的距离初始化为List中的第一个元素也很重要**

* 如果0这个位置有做人，那么tmp将在后面更新，而distance 也会在后面更新；
* 如果0这个位置没有人，那么tmp第一次尝试为0，distance为第一个位置的大小也合理；

## Solution List

```java
//time 32ms 41.6MB
class ExamRoom {
  
    List<Integer> have;
    int capacity;

    public ExamRoom(int N) {
        have=new ArrayList<>();
        capacity=N;
    }
    
    public int seat() {
        if(have.size()==0) {       
            have.add(0);
            return 0;
        }
        int length=have.size();     
        int distance=have.get(0);
        int tmp=0;
        for(int i=0;i<length-1;i++){
            int b=have.get(i+1);
            int a=have.get(i);
            if((b-a)/2>distance){
                distance=(b-a)/2;
                tmp=(b+a)/2;
            }
        }
        if(capacity-1-have.get(length-1)>distance){
               // distance=capacity-1-have.get(length-1);
                tmp=capacity-1;
            }
        
        int index=searchInsert(have,tmp);
        have.add(index,tmp);
        return tmp;
    }
    
    public void leave(int p) {
        have.remove(new Integer(p));
    }
    private  int searchInsert(List<Integer> a,int target){
        int l=0;
        int r=a.size()-1;
        int m=0;
        while(l<=r){
            m=(r-l)/2+l;
            if(a.get(m)<target) l=m+1;
            else r=m-1; 
        }
        return l;
    }
}

/**
 * Your ExamRoom object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ExamRoom obj = new ExamRoom(N);
 * int param_1 = obj.seat();
 * obj.leave(p);
 */
```

## Solution TreeSet

* 优雅的做法

```java
class ExamRoom {
    int N;
    TreeSet<Integer> students;

    public ExamRoom(int N) {
        this.N = N;
        students = new TreeSet();
    }

    public int seat() {
        //Let's determine student, the position of the next
        //student to sit down.
        int student = 0;
        if (students.size() > 0) {
            //Tenatively, dist is the distance to the closest student,
            //which is achieved by sitting in the position 'student'.
            //We start by considering the left-most seat.
            int dist = students.first();
            Integer prev = null;
            for (Integer s: students) {
                if (prev != null) {
                    //For each pair of adjacent students in positions (prev, s),
                    //d is the distance to the closest student;
                    //achieved at position prev + d.
                    int d = (s - prev) / 2;
                    if (d > dist) {
                        dist = d;
                        student = prev + d;
                    }
                }
                prev = s;
            }

            //Considering the right-most seat.
            if (N - 1 - students.last() > dist)
                student = N - 1;
        }

        //Add the student to our sorted TreeSet of positions.
        students.add(student);
        return student;
    }

    public void leave(int p) {
        students.remove(p);
    }
}


```
