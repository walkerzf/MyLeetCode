## [968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

> Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
>
> Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
>
> Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
>
>  
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> ```

>
> ```
> Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

> ```java
> Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

## Solution Greedy DFS

Here is our greedy solution:

1. Set cameras on all leaves' parents, thenremove all covered nodes.
2. Repeat step 1 until all nodes are covered.

* Condition
  * 0: means   it is a leaf 
  * 1: means  it is a parent of a leaf  ,so it must be a node with camera
  * 2: means it is covered without a camera ,so it do not need to be a camera 

or The Chinese Explanation is very impressive 

思路非常清晰，简单。但是花了好一会本弱鸡才把代码捋清😭，按照下面的逻辑把代码写了出来。
		2---孤儿，不需要父母照顾
		1---爸爸，可以照顾儿子和父母
		0---啃老族：爸爸带带我。



两个后继都是孤儿时（2），不需要干任何事，可以化身啃老族（0）。
		当你的后继里面有啃老族（0），你就必须成为爸爸（1）-----camera+1
		当你的后继里面有爸爸（1）时，你又变成里不需要任何照顾的孤儿（2）。

```java
class Solution {
    //Greedy DFS
    //0:leave
    //1: have camera with a leave node 
    //2:  covered without a camera

    int res=0;
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        return((dfs(root)<1)? 1: 0)+res;
    }
    private int dfs(TreeNode root){
        if(root==null) return 2;
        int left=dfs(root.left);
        int right=dfs(root.right);
        if(left==0||right==0) {
            res++;
            return 1;
        }else if(left==1||right==1){
            return 2;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

## Solution SImiliar to House Robber III

* use recursive to solve the problem

* detailed comment in the code  
* very imperssive

```java
   public class Solution{
   class ResultType {
        int subNodesCovered; // all nodes below its level are covered (not including itself)
        int coveredNoCamera; // the node itself is covered by its children
        int coveredCamera; // the node is covered by itself
        ResultType(int subNodesCovered, int coveredNoCamera, int coveredCamera) {
            this.subNodesCovered = subNodesCovered;
            this.coveredNoCamera = coveredNoCamera;
            this.coveredCamera = coveredCamera;
        }
    }
    
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        ResultType resultType = helper(root);
        return Math.min(resultType.coveredNoCamera, resultType.coveredCamera);
    }
    
    private ResultType helper(TreeNode root) {
        //for the intialization
        if(root == null) return new ResultType(0, 0, 99999); // using Integer.MAX will overflow
        
        ResultType left = helper(root.left);
        ResultType right = helper(root.right);
        //rMin means right subTree allcoverd the smallest camera
        int rMin = Math.min(right.coveredNoCamera, right.coveredCamera);
         //lMin means left subTree allcoverd the smallest camera
        int lMin = Math.min(left.coveredNoCamera, left.coveredCamera);
        //subNodeCovered mean except root all node in the root subTree allCovered  smallest Camera
        int subNodesCovered = left.coveredNoCamera + right.coveredNoCamera;
        //root Tree all covered in the condition root have not a camera
        //the min in Two Condition
        //one is left coveredWithCamera +rmin
        //another is right CoverWith Camera +lMin
        int coveredNoCamera = Math.min(left.coveredCamera + rMin, right.coveredCamera + lMin);
        //root Tree Covered in the Condition root have a camere +1
        //the min in Two Condition +1
        //one is left subNodeCovered (left with not camera) and lMin
        //another is right subNodeCovered(right withnot a camera ) and rmin
        int coveredCamera = 1 + Math.min(left.subNodesCovered, lMin) + Math.min(right.subNodesCovered, rMin);
        
        return new ResultType(subNodesCovered, coveredNoCamera, coveredCamera);
    }
   }
```
