## [968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor **its parent, itself, and its immediate children**.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

```
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
**Note:**
```

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
2. **Every** node has value 0.

## Solution 

* we need to define the condition of the node , to postorder iterate the tree

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0;
    //three conditions 
    // 0 means have not covered need parent to be monitor
    // 1 means the covered  do not need parent to be a monitor
    // 2 means the node is a monitor
    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
        res = 0;
        if(!root) return 0;
        if(!root->left&!root->right) return 1;
        if(dfs(root)==0) res+=1;
        return res;
    }
    
    int dfs(TreeNode * root){
        if(!root) return -1;
        int left = dfs(root->left);
        int right = dfs(root->right);
        if(left==-1&&right==-1){
            return 0;
        }
        if(left==0||right==0){
            res+=1;
            return 2;
        }else if(left==2||right==2){
            return 1;
        }else if(left==1||right==1){
            return 0;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
