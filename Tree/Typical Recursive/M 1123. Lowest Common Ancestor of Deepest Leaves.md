## [1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

> Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
>
> Recall that:
>
> The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
> The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
> The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: root = [1,2,3]
> Output: [1,2,3]
> Explanation: 
> The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
> The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
> The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [4]
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: [2,4,5]
> 
> 
> Constraints:
> 
> The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
> Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.

## Solution Recursive

* two global variable

  `dfs` function return the deepest depth of descendants.
  `deepest` represent the deepest depth.
  We use a global variable `lca` to represent the result.
  One pass, Time `O(N)` Space `O(H)`

```java
//time  0ms
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    TreeNode lca;
    int deepest=0;
     public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return lca;
    }
    private int dfs(TreeNode root,int depth){
        deepest=Math.max(deepest,depth);
        //empty node return the depth
        //depth will be th e true depth bigger  than 1
        if(root==null) return depth;
        int left=dfs(root.left,depth+1);
        int right=dfs(root.right,depth+1);
        if(left==deepest&&right==deepest){
            lca=root;
        }
        return Math.max(left,right);
    } 
}

```



``dfs`` function return the subtree `height` and `lca` and at the same time.
		`null` node will return depth 0,
		leaves will return depth 1.



```java
//time  0ms
class Solution {
    class Pair{
        TreeNode node;
        int depth;
        public Pair(TreeNode node,int depth){
            this.node=node;
            this.depth=depth;
        }
    }
    public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        Pair p=getLcs(root,0);
        return p.node;   
    }
    private Pair getLcs(TreeNode root,int depth){
        //empty node will  return depth 
        //because the empty node 's parent may be the answer
        //self  will be the answer  of course not be an answer
        if(root ==null  ) return new Pair(null,depth);
        Pair l=getLcs(root.left,depth+1);
        Pair r=getLcs(root.right,depth+1);
        //we keep the biggest depth ,and return the parent root
        if(l.depth==r.depth) return new Pair(root,l.depth);
        //return bigger depth 
        else return (l.depth>r.depth)?l:r; 
    }
}
```
