## [802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/)

> In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.
>
> Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.
>
> Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.
>
> The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the length of graph.  The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph.
>
> Example:
> Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
> Output: [2,4,5,6]
> Here is a diagram of the above graph.

>
> Note:
>
> graph will have length at most 10000.
> The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000.
> Each graph[i] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range [0, graph.length - 1].

## Solution 需要信息记录节点的状态

```java
//time 12ms 47.7MB
class Solution {
    //0为未访问 1为正在访问 再一次碰到正在访问就标记为unsafe  2为safe 3为unsafe 即有环
    State visited[];
    List<Integer> a;
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        if(graph.length==0) return new LinkedList();

        for(int i=0;i<visited.length;i++){
