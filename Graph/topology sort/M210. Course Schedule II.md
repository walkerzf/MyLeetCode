## [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

> There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
>
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
>
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
>
> There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
> Output: [0,1]
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
>              course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
> Example 2:
>
> Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
> Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
>              courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
>              So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
> Note:
>
> The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
> You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
