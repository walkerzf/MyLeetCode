## [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected** graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[u, v]` with `u < v`, that represents an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge `[u, v]` should be in the same format, with `u < v`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```

**Note:**

The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.

Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

## Solution  Union find

```c++
int fa[1010];
int getfa(int fa[],int f){
    if(fa[f]==f) return f;
    else{
        fa[f] = getfa(fa,fa[f]);
        return fa[f];
    }
}
bool merge(int fa[],int x ,int y){
    int fx = getfa(fa,x);
    int fy = getfa(fa,y);
    if(fx==fy) return false;
    else{
        if(fx>=fy) swap(fx,fy);
        fa[fx] = fy;
    }
    return true;
}

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int v = edges.size();
        for(int i =1;i<=v;i++) fa[i] = i;
        int index = 0;
        for(;index<edges.size()&&v>1;index++){
            int x = edges[index][0];
            int y = edges[index][1];
            if(!merge(fa,x,y)) return edges[index];
        }
        return edges[index];
    }
};
```

we may need to fix the answer to

```java
 public void union(int[] father, int x, int y) {
        int xFather = findXFather(father, x);
        int yFather = findXFather(father, y);
        if (xFather != yFather) {
            father[xFather]=yFather;
        } else {
            //在发现两个点的连接已经存在时，就更新缓存，题目要最后一个，遍历到最后一个就是结果
            result[0] = x;
            result[1] = y;
        }
    }

```
