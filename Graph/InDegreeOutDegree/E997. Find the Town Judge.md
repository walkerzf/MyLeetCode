## [997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

> In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
>
> If the town judge exists, then:
>
> The town judge trusts nobody.
> Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
> There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
> You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
>
> If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.
>
>  
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
> Output: 2
> Example 2:
>
> Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
> Output: 3
> Example 3:
>
> Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
> Output: -1
> Example 4:
>
> Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
> Output: -1
> Example 5:
>
> Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
> Output: 3
>
>
> Note:
>
> 1 <= N <= 1000
> trust.length <= 10000
> trust[i] are all different
> trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
> 1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

## Solution Indegree OutDegree

```java
//time 3ms 47.4MB
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
        int []inDegree=new int[N+1];
        int []outDegree=new int[N+1];
        for(int i=0;i<trust.length;i++){
            int out=trust[i][0];
            int in=trust[i][1];
            inDegree[in]++;
            outDegree[out]++;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<N+1;i++){
            if(inDegree[i]==N-1&&outDegree[i]==0) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

* optimization
* 可以将入度出度的数组优化成一个

```java
//time 3ms 47.6MB
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
        int []count=new int[N+1];
        for(int i=0;i<trust.length;i++){
            count[trust[i][0]]--;
            count[trust[i][1]]++;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<N+1;i++){
            if(count[i]==N-1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
