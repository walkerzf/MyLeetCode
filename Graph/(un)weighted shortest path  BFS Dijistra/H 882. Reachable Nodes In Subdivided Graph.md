## [882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/reachable-nodes-in-subdivided-graph/)

> Starting with an **undirected** graph (the "original graph") with nodes from `0` to `N-1`, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.
>
> The graph is given as follows: `edges[k]` is a list of integer pairs `(i, j, n)` such that `(i, j)` is an edge of the original graph,
>
> and `n` is the total number of **new** nodes on that edge. 
>
> Then, the edge `(i, j)` is deleted from the original graph, `n` new nodes `(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` are added to the original graph,
>
> and `n+1` new edges `(i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j)` are added to the original graph.
>
> Now, you start at node `0` from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one edge. 
>
> Return how many nodes you can reach in at most `M` moves.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3
> Output: 13
> Explanation: 
> The nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4
> Output: 23
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
> 2. `0 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] < N`
> 3. There does not exist any `i != j` for which `edges[i][0] == edges[j][0]` and `edges[i][1] == edges[j][1]`.
> 4. The original graph has no parallel edges.
> 5. `0 <= edges[i][2] <= 10000`
> 6. `0 <= M <= 10^9`
> 7. `1 <= N <= 3000`
> 8. A reachable node is a node that can be travelled to using at most M moves starting from node 0.

## Solution Dijistra +PriorityQueue

* 堆优化的```Dijistra ```
* we  select the max Move left to choose next node ,and add the next node to PriorityQueue 
* we poll the max Move left 
* and update the next Node information ,when have same node in the Queue ,we choose the max move left one 

```java
//time  62ms
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int M, int N) {
        //start at node zero 
        Map<Integer,Map<Integer,Integer>>  m = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0 ;i<N;i++) m.put(i,new HashMap<>());
        for(int e[]:edges){
        
            m.get(e[0]).put(e[1],e[2]+1);
            m.get(e[1]).put(e[0],e[2]+1);
        }
        // move left + node 
        PriorityQueue<int []> q =new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b[0]-a[0]);
        q.add(new int[]{M,0});
