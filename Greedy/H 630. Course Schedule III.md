## [630. Course Schedule III](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/)

> There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. Each course has some duration(course length) t and closed on dth day. A course should be taken continuously for t days and must be finished before or on the dth day. You will start at the 1st day.
>
> ```
> Given n online courses represented by pairs (t,d), your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.
> 
> Example:
> 
> Input: [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
> First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
> Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
> Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
> The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.
> 
> 
> Note:
> 
> The integer 1 <= d, t, n <= 10,000.
> You can't take two courses simultaneously.

## Solution 

* the general idea is sort the array as the end time  increasing  order
* but in the special case ,we meet the end time early ,but cost time long ,  after it ,we meet the end time late but cost time short ,we can exchange the order ,so we can make use of time as much as possible ,we can learn more classes

```java
class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        //start  lastest time 

        int startLastTime []=new int[courses.length];
        PriorityQueue <int [] > q = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)-> a[1]-b[1]);
        PriorityQueue <Integer > reserved =new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b-a);
        for(int i=0 ;i < startLastTime.length ; i++){
            q.add(courses[i]);
        }
        int res=0;
        int current =0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int top [] =q.poll();
            if(current+top[0]<=top[1]){
                current+=top[0];
                reserved.add(top[0]);
            }else{
                reserved.add(top[0]);
                current=current+top[0]-reserved.poll();
            }
        }
        return reserved.size();
    }
}
```

* we do not have to use PriorityQueue to deal with the array courses ,we can sort the array

```java
class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        //根据课程结束时间升序排列
        Arrays.sort(courses,(a,b) -> (a[1]-b[1]));
        //课程用时的大根优先级队列
        Queue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> (b-a));
        int time = 0;
        for (int[] temp: courses) {
            if (time + temp[0] <= temp[1]) {
                queue.offer(temp[0]);
                time += temp[0];
            } else if (!queue.isEmpty() && queue.peek() > temp[0]) {
                time += temp[0] - queue.poll();
                queue.offer(temp[0]);
            }
        }
        return queue.size();
    }
}
```
