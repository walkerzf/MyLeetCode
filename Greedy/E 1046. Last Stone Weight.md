## [1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

> We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.
>
> Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
>
> If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
> If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
> At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
>
> ```
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: 
> We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
> we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
> we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
> we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
> 
> 
> Note:
> 
> 1 <= stones.length <= 30
> 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

## Solution Greedy  

* Heap or Array

  ```java
  class Solution {
      public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
          PriorityQueue<Integer> q=new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b-a);
          for(int i=0;i<stones.length;i++){
              q.add(stones[i]);
          }
          while(q.size()>1){
              int num1=q.poll();
              int num2=q.poll();
              int res=Math.abs(num1-num2);
              q.add(res);
          }
          return q.poll();
      }
  }
  class Solution {
      public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
          int len = stones.length;
          for(int i = 0; i < len - 1;i++){
              Arrays.sort(stones);
              stones[len - 1] -= stones[len - 2];
              stones[len - 2] = 0;
          }
          return stones[stones.length - 1];
      }
  }
