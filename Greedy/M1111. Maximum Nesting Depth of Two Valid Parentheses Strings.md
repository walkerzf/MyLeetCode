## [1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-two-valid-parentheses-strings/)

> A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:
>
> It is the empty string, or
> It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
> It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
> We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:
>
> depth("") = 0
> depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
> depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
> For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.
>
>  
>
> Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).
>
> Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.
>
> Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

> Example 1:

> Input: seq = "(()())"

> Example 2:

> Output: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]

## Solution  No extra Space

```java
class Solution{
    public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
      int[] res = new int[seq.length()];
      for (int i = 0, depth = 0; i < seq.length(); ++i) {
        if (seq.charAt(i) == '(') res[i] = depth++ % 2;
        //要去掉一个高度
          else res[i] = --depth % 2;
      }
      return res;
    }
}
```

```java
 public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
        int n = seq.length(), res[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            res[i] = seq.charAt(i) == '(' ? i & 1 : (1 - i & 1);
        return res;
    }
```
