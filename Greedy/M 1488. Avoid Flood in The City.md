## [1488. Avoid Flood in The City](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/avoid-flood-in-the-city/)

> Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.
>
> ```
> Given an integer array rains where:
> 
> rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
> rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.
> Return an array ans where:
> 
> ans.length == rains.length
> ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
> ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.
> If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.
> 
> Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)
> ```
>
> ```
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
> Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
> After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
> After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
> After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
> There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
> Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
> Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
> After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
> After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
> After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
> After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
> After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
> It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
> Output: []
> Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.
> After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.
> Example 4:
> 
> Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
> Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
> Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9
> Example 5:
> 
> Input: rains = [10,20,20]
> Output: []
> Explanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.
> 
> 
> Constraints:
> 
> 1 <= rains.length <= 10^5
> 0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9

## Solution 

* In the contest , i use the deque to  store the norain day ,when i meet the  identical rainPosition, we pop the nearest position  from  the last Rain day 

```java
//timee 58ms 
class Solution {
    // last one greedy not work
    // first one greedy we need to as soon as possible 
    // we chou shui  as soon as possible 
    public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
        int ans[] =new int[rains.length];
        //without rain day index
        Deque<Integer> norain =new LinkedList<>();
        //rain day index
        //Set<Integer> r =new HashSet<>();
        Map<Integer,Integer> r =new HashMap<>();
        int start =0;
        //for the begin ones 
        while(rains[start]==0){
            ans[start++]=1;
        }
        for(int i =start;i<rains.length;i++){
            if(rains[i]>0){
                if(!r.containsKey(rains[i])){
                    ans[i]=-1;
                    r.put(rains[i],i);
                    continue;
                }else{
                    if(norain.size()==0) return new int[]{};
                    // find the nearest from the rainday 
                    Stack<Integer> tmp =new Stack<>();
                    while(!norain.isEmpty()&&norain.peekFirst()<r.get(rains[i])){
                        tmp.push(norain.pollFirst());
                    }
                    if(norain.isEmpty()) return new int[]{};
                    int index = norain.pollFirst();
                    r.remove(rains[i]);
                    r.put(rains[i],i);
                    ans[index] = rains[i];
                    ans[i]=-1;
                    // pop to addFirst
                    while(!tmp.isEmpty()){
                        norain.addFirst(tmp.pop());
                    }
                }
            }else{
                norain.addLast(i);
            }
        }
        //we can initilize the array to 1 , we can skip the iterative 
        while(!norain.isEmpty()){
            ans[norain.pop()]= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

 or we can use the TreeSet to store the no rain day ,and use api ```ceiling``` to get the nearest position 

```java
//time 90ms 。。。
class Solution {
    public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
        // the previous appeared idx of rains[i]
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        TreeSet<Integer> zeros = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] res = new int[rains.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < rains.length; i++) {
            if (rains[i] == 0) {
                zeros.add(i);
            } else {
                if (map.containsKey(rains[i])) {
                    // find the location of zero that can be used to empty rains[i]
                    Integer next = zeros.ceiling(map.get(rains[i]));
                    if (next == null) return new int[0];
                    res[next] = rains[i];
                    zeros.remove(next);
                }
                res[i] = -1;
				map.put(rains[i], i);
            }
        }
        for (int i : zeros) res[i] = 1;
        return res;
    }
}
```



* we can fix it to the Binary Search and Array List  

```java

//time 174ms

    // last one greedy not work
    // first one greedy we need to as soon as possible 
    // we chou shui  as soon as possible

        int ans[] = new int[rains.length];
        Arrays.fill(ans, 1);
        //without rain day index
        List<Integer> norain = new ArrayList<>();
        //rain day index
        //Set<Integer> r =new HashSet<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> r = new HashMap<>();
        int start = 0;
        //for the begin ones 
        while (rains[start] == 0) {
            ans[start++] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < rains.length; i++) {
            if (rains[i] > 0) {
                if (!r.containsKey(rains[i])) {
                    ans[i] = -1;
                    r.put(rains[i], i);
                    continue;
                } else {
                    if (norain.size() == 0) return new int[]{};
                    // find the nearest from the rainday 
                    int pre = r.get(rains[i]);
                    int index = binarySearch(norain, pre);
                    int indexToPosition =0;
                    if (index == -1) return new int[]{};
                    else {
                        indexToPosition = norain.get(index);    
                        norain.remove(index);
                    }
                    r.remove(rains[i]);
                    r.put(rains[i], i);
                    ans[indexToPosition] = rains[i];
                    ans[i] = -1;
                }
            } else {
                norain.add(i);
            }
        }
        //we can initilize the array to 1 , we can skip the iterative 
//        while(!norain.isEmpty()){

        return ans;
    }

    private int binarySearch(List <Integer> norain, int pre) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = norain.size() - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = (r - l) / 2 + l;
            if (norain.get(mid ) < pre) {
