## [649. Dota2 Senate](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/dota2-senate/)

> In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the `Radiant` and the `Dire`.
>
> The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the senate wants to make a decision about a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise `one` of the two rights:
>
> 1. `Ban one senator's right`:
>    A senator can make another senator lose **all his rights** in this and all the following rounds.
> 2. `Announce the victory`:
>    If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from **the same party**, he can announce the victory and make the decision about the change in the game.
>
>  
>
> Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the `Radiant` party and the `Dire` party respectively. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.
>
> The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
>
> Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party, you need to predict which party will finally announce the victory and make the change in the Dota2 game. The output should be `Radiant` or `Dire`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: "RD"
> Output: "Radiant"
> Explanation: The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1. 
> And the second senator can't exercise any rights any more since his right has been banned. 
> And in the round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
> ```

> **Example 2:**

> ```
> Input: "RDD"
> Output: "Dire"
> Explanation: 
> The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1. 
> And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
> And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in the round 1. 
> And in the round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

* The basic idea is to ban next person who is not the same party 
* we see the  existing part will  be which pary

## Solution 

* pure loop
* easy to understand but not elegant
* we have a big true loop ,in the loop we have a flag ```unchanged```
  * in the inner loop
  * we  loop the string ,and make some tag
  * after the loop,we check if we get the right answe 
    * we need to update res =```  ```  before check

```java
//time  7ms
class Solution {
    public String predictPartyVictory(String senate) {
        int len =senate.length();
        boolean vaild []=new boolean[len];
        Arrays.fill(vaild,true);
        int canSkipR=0;
        int canSkipD=0;
        char ss[]=senate.toCharArray();
        String res="";
    while(true){
        for(int i=0;i<ss.length;i++){
            if(vaild[i]==true){
                if(ss[i]=='R') {
                    if(canSkipR==0){
                        canSkipD++;
                    }else{
                        vaild[i]=false;
                        canSkipR--;
                    }
                } else  if(ss[i]=='D'){
                    if(canSkipD==0){
                        canSkipR++;
                    }else{
                        vaild[i]=false;
                        canSkipD--;
                    }
                }
            } 
        }
        boolean unchanged =true;
        //update res to avoid dead loop
        res="";
            for(int i=0;i<len ;i++){
                if(vaild[i]==true&&res==""){
                    res= ((ss[i]=='R')? "Radiant" :"Dire");
                } else if(vaild[i]==true&&res!=""){
                    unchanged= (res.charAt(0)==ss[i]);
                    if(!unchanged) break;
                }
            }
            if(unchanged) break;
    }
        return res ;
    }
}
```

## Solution 

```java
    public String predictPartyVictory(String senate) {
        Queue<Integer> q1 = new LinkedList<Integer>(), q2 = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        int n = senate.length();
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            if(senate.charAt(i) == 'R')q1.add(i);
            else q2.add(i);
        }
        while(!q1.isEmpty() && !q2.isEmpty()){
            int r_index = q1.poll(), d_index = q2.poll();
            //we store the min index and throw the bigger index 
            //at the same time we get one  in one party
            
            //+n means next loop ,for the comparation between the index in R and D
            if(r_index < d_index)q1.add(r_index + n);
            else q2.add(d_index + n);
        }
        //when any party is Empty ,we will get the answer
        return (q1.size() > q2.size())? "Radiant" : "Dire";
    }
```





```
It is not hard to see the greedy way to win is to ban next earliest opponent in a circle.
I use a variable "count" for how many R or D, and a string s for the state after current iteration. count > 0 means more active R, while count < 0 means more active D. When encountering 'D', if count > 0, this 'D' is banned, and count--. This 'D' is not appended to string s. If count <= 0, it will be appended to s.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string predictPartyVictory(string senate) {
        int count = 0, len = 0;
        // When the length of senate doesn't decrease, the game is over.
        while (senate.size() != len) {
            string s;
            len = senate.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                //>=0 means active R
                if (senate[i] == 'R') {
                    if (count++ >= 0) s += 'R';
                }
                //<=0 means active D
                else if (senate[i] == 'D') {
                    if (count-- <= 0) s += 'D';
                }
            }  
            swap(s, senate);
        }
        if (senate[0] == 'R') 
            return "Radiant";
        else 
            return "Dire";
    }
};
```

* we record the need to ban times in the array



```java
class Solution {
    public String predictPartyVictory(String senate) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList();
        int[] people = new int[]{0, 0};
        int[] bans = new int[]{0, 0};

        for (char person: senate.toCharArray()) {
            int x = person == 'R' ? 1 : 0;
            people[x]++;
            queue.add(x);
        }

        while (people[0] > 0 && people[1] > 0) {
            int x = queue.poll();
            if (bans[x] > 0) {
                bans[x]--;
                people[x]--;
            } else {
                bans[x^1]++;
                // no need to ban ,we save the index at last
                //for the circle
                queue.add(x);
            }
        }

        return people[1] > 0 ? "Radiant" : "Dire";
    }
}
```
