## [458. Poor Pigs](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/poor-pigs/)

> There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?
>
> Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.

> General case:
> 
> If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.
> ```

> ```
> Note:
> 
> A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and the feeding takes no time.
> After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a cool down time of m minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feedings at all.
> Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of pigs).
> ```

## Solution

Ref:1000桶水，其中一桶有毒，猪喝毒水后会在15分钟内死去，想用一个小时找到这桶毒水，至少需要几头猪？ - 苗华栋的回答 - 知乎 https://www.zhihu.com/question/60227816/answer/1274071217

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        //one pig in the limited time   can represents situations 
        int base = minutesToTest/minutesToDie +1;
        // we need how many pigs to represents buckets 
        double ans = Math.log(buckets)/Math.log(base);
        return (int)(Math.ceil(ans));

    }
}

```
