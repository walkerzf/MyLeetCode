## [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Given a non negative integer number **num**. For every numbers **i** in the range **0 ≤ i ≤ num** calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time **O(n\*sizeof(integer))**. But can you do it in linear time **O(n)** /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be **O(n)**.
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like **__builtin_popcount** in c++ or in any other language.

## Solution the lowest bis

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        vector<int> res(num+1);
        for(int i = 1 ;i<=num;i++){
            res[i] = res[i/2] +i%2;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Solution highest bits

Ref:[LC](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/counting-bits/solution/bi-te-wei-ji-shu-by-leetcode/)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
        int i = 0, b = 1;
        // [0, b) is calculated
        while (b <= num) {
            // generate [b, 2b) or [b, num) from [0, b)
            while(i < b && i + b <= num){
                ans[i + b] = ans[i] + 1;
                ++i;
            }
            i = 0;   // reset i
            b <<= 1; // b = 2b
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
