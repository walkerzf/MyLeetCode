## [227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

> Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
>
> The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: "3+2*2"
> Output: 7
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: " 3/2 "
> Output: 1
> Example 3:
>
