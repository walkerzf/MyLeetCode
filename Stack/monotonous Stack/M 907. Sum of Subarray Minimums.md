## [907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)

> 
> Given an array of integers `A`, find the sum of `min(B)`, where `B` ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `A`.
>
> Since the answer may be large, **return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.**
>
>  **Example 1:**
>
> ```
>Input: [3,1,2,4]
> Output: 17
> Explanation: Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3,1], [1,2], [2,4], [3,1,2], [1,2,4], [3,1,2,4]. 
> Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.  Sum is 17.
> ```
> 
> **Note:**
>
>  1. `1 <= A.length <= 30000`
>2. `1 <= A[i] <= 30000`

**Stack Problem**

similiar to[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/) ,we find pre smaller index and next smaller index

* the general idea is to calculate the  i_th number as the minimum  , how many the subarrays 
  * we need the index of  previous smaller number
  * we need to know the index of next smaller number
  * when get two index ,we get two distance ,so we get the number of subarrays as the i_th number as the  min
