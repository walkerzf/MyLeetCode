## [503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

> Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
>
> ```
> Example 1:
> Input: [1,2,1]
> Output: [2,-1,2]
> Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
> The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
> The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

## Solution Stack

* loop twice for circle Array

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int len=nums.length;
        int res[] = new int[len];
        Arrays.fill(res,-1);
        Stack<Integer> s=new Stack<>();
        for(int i=0;i<len*2;i++){
            while(!s.isEmpty()&&nums[s.peek()]<nums[i%len]){
                res[s.pop()]=nums[i%len];
            }
            s.push(i%len);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
