## [478. Generate Random Point in a Circle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/generate-random-point-in-a-circle/)

> Given the radius and x-y positions of the center of a circle, write a function randPoint which generates a uniform random point in the circle.
>
> ```
> Note:
> 
> input and output values are in floating-point.
> radius and x-y position of the center of the circle is passed into the class constructor.
> a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle.
> randPoint returns a size 2 array containing x-position and y-position of the random point, in that order.
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: 
> ["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
> [[1,0,0],[],[],[]]
> Output: [null,[-0.72939,-0.65505],[-0.78502,-0.28626],[-0.83119,-0.19803]]
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: 
> ["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
> [[10,5,-7.5],[],[],[]]
> Output: [null,[11.52438,-8.33273],[2.46992,-16.21705],[11.13430,-12.42337]]
> Explanation of Input Syntax:
> 
> The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has three arguments, the radius, x-position of the center, and y-position of the center of the circle. randPoint has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

* we generate random points in square ,and accept it when it is in the circle 
* we generate random radius and random theta

## Solution 

```java
class Solution {
    double rad, xc, yc;
    public Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) {
        rad = radius;
        xc = x_center;
        yc = y_center;
    }

    public double[] randPoint() {
        double x0 = xc - rad;
        double y0 = yc - rad;

        while(true) {
            double xg = x0 + Math.random() * rad * 2;
            double yg = y0 + Math.random() * rad * 2;
            if (Math.sqrt(Math.pow((xg - xc) , 2) + Math.pow((yg - yc), 2)) <= rad)
                return new double[]{xg, yg};
        }
    }
}
```



## Solution 

```javaclass Solution {
class Solution {
    double x , y ,radius;
    public Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) {
        this.x = x_center;
        this.y = y_center;
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    public double[] randPoint() {
        double r = Math.sqrt(Math.random()*radius*radius);
        double theta = Math.PI*2*Math.random();
        return new double[]{x+r*Math.cos(theta),y+r*Math.sin(theta)};
    }
}
```
