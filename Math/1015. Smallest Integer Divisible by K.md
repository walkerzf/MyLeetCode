## [1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/)

Given a positive integer `K`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit `1`.

Return *the **length** of* `N`. If there is no such `N`, return -1.

**Note:** `N` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= K <= 105`

* 充分性和必要性

* `xi+1 = 10*xi +1`  and we can have `x = pK +q`

* so `(10xi+1)%K = (10*(pK+q)+1)%K` => `(10*xi+1)%K=(10*q+1)%K `

  `xi = pK+q`

  so we have `(10xi + 1)%K = (10(xi%K)+1)%K`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        if(K%2 ==0 || K%5==0)
            return -1;//dead loop
        int n =1 ;
        int len = 1;
        while(n%K){
            n%=K;
            n =n*10+1;
            len++;
        }
        return len;
    }
};
```
