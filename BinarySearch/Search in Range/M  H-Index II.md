##  H-Index II

> Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
>
> According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
>              received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
>              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
>              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
>
> **Follow up:**
>
> - This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
> - Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

# Solution Binary Search

when the input is sorted and the time complexity is log ,we need binary Search

we need to know  the index -h really means waht 

a liitle rao 

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int N =citations.length ;
        int l = 0;
        int r = N-1;
        while(l<=r){
            int mid =(r-l)/2 +l;
            if(citations[mid]==N-mid) return N-mid;
            else if(citations[mid]>N-mid){
                r =mid -1;
            }else{
                l=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return N-l;
    }
}
```
