## [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

> Given an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
>
> Note:
>
> 1. `1 <= w.length <= 10000`
> 2. `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
> 3. `pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: 
> ["Solution","pickIndex"]
> [[[1]],[]]
> Output: [null,0]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: 
> ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
> [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
> Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
> ```
>
> **Explanation of Input Syntax:**
>
> The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array `w`. `pickIndex` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## Solution Binary Search

* The intuition is calculate the possibility of the  every index ,and use the possibility to  generator the sequence 
* But the possibility is ```  0 < P < 1```  ï¼Œwe can use the weight to cut the region ,and use ```Random ``` to generate the number in all region ,to decide which region that it belongs to ,and return the index

```java
import java.util.Random;

class Solution {
    int sum=0;
    int presum [];
    Random random =new Random();
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        presum =  new int [w.length];
        for(int i=0;i<presum.length ;i++){
            sum+=w[i];
            presum[i]=sum;
        }
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        //left  index
        //right index
        int l = 0 ;
        int r = presum.length -1;
        int max = presum[r];
        //possility
        int target =random.nextInt(max)+1;
        
        while(l<r){
            int mid = l+ (r -l )/2 ;
            if(presum[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }else if( presum[mid] <target){
                l= mid+1 ;
            }else{
                r =mid;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
